TheCyrus Cylinderis an ancient clay cylinder, now broken into several pieces, on which is written anAchaemenid royal inscriptioninAkkadiancuneiformscript in the name of thePersiankingCyrus the Great.[2][3]It dates from the 6th century BC and was discovered in the ruins of the ancientMesopotamiancity ofBabylon(now in modernIraq) in 1879.[2]It is currently in the possession of theBritish Museum. It was created and used as afoundation depositfollowing thePersian conquest of Babylonin 539 BC, when theNeo-Babylonian Empirewas invaded by Cyrus and incorporated into hisPersian Empire.
The text on the Cylinder praises Cyrus, sets out his genealogy and portrays him as a king from a line of kings. The Babylonian kingNabonidus, who was defeated and deposed by Cyrus, is denounced as an impious oppressor of the people of Babylonia and his low-born origins are implicitly contrasted to Cyrus' kingly heritage. The victorious Cyrus is portrayed as having been chosen by the chief Babylonian godMardukto restore peace and order to the Babylonians. The text states that Cyrus was welcomed by the people of Babylon as their new ruler and entered the city in peace. It appeals to Marduk to protect and help Cyrus and his sonCambyses. It extols Cyrus as a benefactor of the citizens of Babylonia who improved their lives, repatriated displaced people and restored temples and cult sanctuaries acrossMesopotamiaand elsewhere in the region. It concludes with a description of how Cyrus repaired the city wall of Babylon and found a similar inscription placed there by an earlier king.[3]
The Cylinder's text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus' policy of therepatriationof theJewish peoplefollowing theirBabylonian captivity[4](an act that theBook of Ezraattributes to Cyrus[5]), as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples.[6]This interpretation has been disputed, as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries, and makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea.[7]Nonetheless, it has been seen as a sign of Cyrus's relatively enlightened approach towards cultural and religious diversity.Neil MacGregor, a former director of theBritish Museum, said that the cylinder was "the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths – a new kind of statecraft".[8]
In modern times, the Cylinder was adopted as anational symbolof Iran by the rulingPahlavi dynasty, which put it on display inTehranin 1971 to commemorate the2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire.[9]PrincessAshraf PahlavipresentedUnited Nations Secretary GeneralU Thantwith a replica of the Cylinder. The princess asserted that "the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding, tolerance, courage, compassion and, above all, human liberty".[10]Her brother,ShahMohammad Reza Pahlavi, promoted the Cylinder as the "first charter of human rights", though this interpretation has been described by various historians as "ratheranachronistic" and controversial.[11][12][13][14]
